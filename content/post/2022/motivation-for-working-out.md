Struggling with motivation is what everyone goes through when working out. Your "why" is what will keep you from going back to the couch and being lazy. If you are working out too look good, then you will lose the motivation once you find a partner. It needs to be stronger than that. 

The strongest "why" that I have found was from both my grandfather and father dying in their 50s. Their diet was not good, and you can learn just as much from a bad example than a good one. My why is very simple and strong... "I'm afraid of death". As time goes on, my why becomes strong when I get older.
